## _**Optical simulation MODEL using Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for flat multilayer structures**_
  
### How to start
- Setup Simulation input: "input.yaml". Wide range of wavelengths and incident angles can be explored.
- Include materials' nk files in the "./nk_lib" folder
- Unit is nanometer
- Execute the run.sh file in terminal (>>sh run.sh)
